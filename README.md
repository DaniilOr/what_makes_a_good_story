# what_makes_a_good_story
Well, it is the first thing I wanted to create as a Data Scientist. There is a group (https://vk.com/styd.pozor) in VK social network where people share some shameful stories, I like reading it but some stories are quite boring. In order to make the search for good stories easier, I decided to create a software which could predict if a given story 'Goog'. ('Good story' for me is a story with likes/views ratio higher than 1%).
